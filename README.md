# Language Detector

### Software or a program used to determine the language in which a particular text is written is called a language detector. A language detector's main function is to automatically identify the language of an input, which has several uses. Analyzing the input text's linguistic characteristics and statistical patterns is a common step in the language detection process. For this objective, machine learning algorithms are frequently used, with models trained on big datasets with text samples in many languages. These models can predict the language of new, unseen material by learning patterns characteristic of particular languages.
