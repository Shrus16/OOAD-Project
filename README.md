# Language Detector

### A language detector is a type of software or tool designed to identify the language in which a given piece of text is written. The primary purpose of a language detector is to automatically determine the language of a given input, which can be useful in various applications. The language detection process typically involves analyzing the statistical patterns and linguistic features of the input text. Machine learning algorithms are commonly employed for this task, using models trained on large datasets containing text samples from various languages. These models learn patterns that are indicative of specific languages and can then predict the language of new, unseen text.
